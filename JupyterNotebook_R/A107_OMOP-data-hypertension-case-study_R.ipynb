In addition to analysing hypertension within OMOP data, we will investigate how different OMOP tables interact and how to use spark within r to perform analysis on large tables. The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics community developed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model, which is a standardised healthcare data model. OMOP is designed to standardise the structure and content of observational data and enable efficient analyses. The goal of the notebook is to demonstrate methods described for finding, extracting, and classifying hypertension data from the OMOP data. The data utilised in constructing the OMOP dataset was provided by UKBiobank to in 2018. Consequently, any existing data issues from 2018 persist in the current OMOP dataset. Known issues will be noted within the relevant OMOP field. All figures produces are accurate at the time of writing (Q1-2024). Currently the data dictionary does not contain the correct data types for the columns within the omop tables. However, the columns tab within data showcase reports the correct column data type.
